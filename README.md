# UnityCoroutinesInGodot

## About 

Hi. I'm a Unity developer who jumped ship to Godot. 
I'm used to Unity's coroutines, so I decided to make something that recreates 
how coroutines work in Godot. 

This is specifically for Godot 3. 

This is started as of 9/16/2023.

## Installation

- Download the repo. 
- Throw it into your project. 
- Goto Project > Project Settings > AutoLoad
- Add CoroutineRunner.tscn to your AutoLoad. 

You should be good to go.
